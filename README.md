# Abra Schemas

Abra uses a JSON schema to configure your Abra blocks. You can change your schema to integrate better with your theme and create richer online store experiences for buyers.

This repo contains all the schemas for the themes we support so you can use them as examples for your store.

## Contributing

### Commands

To start working, use:

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

To do a one-off build, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

To run tests, use `npm test` or `yarn test`.

### Testing

Jest tests are set up to run with `npm test` or `yarn test`.
